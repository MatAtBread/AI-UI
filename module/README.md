### AI-UI

AI-UI ("Async Iterator User Interface") is a tiny, genuinely functional, UI framework for building dynamic HTML pages

It has 4 main features:

* A simple mechanism for defining and using standard DOM elements, encouraging both composition _and_ inheritance
* A super-cool syntax (`when`) for inter-component communication using standard DOM events 
* Dynamic DOM attributes and contents via standard JS async constructs - set your styles & contents with Promises and async iterables.
* A set of extensions to the standard browser/JS async iterables & generators, like map, filter, throttle, broadcast...

Design goals for AI-UI are:

* Full use and compatability with standard DOM elements, events and JS async constructs like Promises, generators & iterators - no Proxy voodoo, special compilation steps, additional syntax, virtual DOM or complex API to learn. Freely mix and match with _any_ existing UI library which renders HTML.
* Tiny footprint (6Kb minified)
* Purely client-side, but of course being bullt standard JS & DOM Elements, can be generated by your favourite dev tools.
* First-class support for Typescript (it is written in Typescript), prompting you with a rich set interfaces for your newly defined tags, and supports `tsx` if you're a fan.

Think of it as a spreadsheet in your browser - you define the elements, styles and contents by referencing other elements and data sources, and you can encapsulate you dynamic tags for instant re-use.

## Use in a browser

* ES6 import
```
  import * as AIUI from 'https://www.unpkg.com/@matatbread/ai-ui/esm/ai-ui.js'; 
  // You can, of course, just import the members you need...
  import { tag } from 'https://www.unpkg.com/@matatbread/ai-ui/esm/ai-ui.js'; 
```

* HTML `<script>` tag
```
  <script src="https://www.unpkg.com/@matatbread/ai-ui/lib/ai-ui.min.js"></script> 
  <!-- defines global AIUI -->
```

Get started with simple, easy to maintain web pages that work seamlessly with user-input, remote data sources and other dynamic sources of data and interaction without the complexity of a bespoke build or execution framework.
