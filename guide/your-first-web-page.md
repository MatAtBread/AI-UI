# Your first web-page

Here's an example of a very simple web page, with the content generated by AI-UI.

```html
<head>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/@matatbread/ai-ui/dist/ai-ui.js"></script>
</head>

<body>
</body>
<script>
  /* Specify what base tags you reference in your UI */
  const { h2, div } = AIUI.tag();

  /* Define a _new_ tag type, called `App`, based on the standard "<div>" tag, 
    that is composed of an h2 and div elements. It will generate markup like:

  <div>
      <h2>Hello World</h2>
      <div>Dunno</div>
  </div>

  */

  const App = div.extended({
    constructed() {
      /* When constructed, this "div" tag contains some other tags: */
      return [
        h2("Hello World"),  // h2(...) is "tag function". I generates an "h2" DOM element with the specified children
        div("Dunno")        // div(...) is also "tag function". I generates an "div" DOM element with the specified children
      ]
    }
  });

  /* Add add it to the document so the user can see it! */
  document.body.appendChild(
    App({   // App(...) is also a "tag function", which generates a "div" containing the DOM tree return by constructed()
      style:{
        color: 'blue'
      }
    },
    'Your first web page')
  );

  // All the "tag functions" operate in the same way - they generate standard DOM nodes and can accept a variable number
  // of children, optionally preceded by an object containing attributes for the DOM node
</script>
```

So far, so what? Another way of declaring HTML? Not exactly ground-breaking.

The `AIUI.tag()` API returns a collection of functions that create a standard DOM node of the specified name. These are just normal DOM nodes, created via [document.createElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement), and therefore have all the features and behaviours of standard DOM nodes. 

Like the `div(....)` method (and all tag functions returned by `AIUI.tag()`), the new `App(...)` function optionally accepts an object specifying its attributes as the first arguemnt, and an optional list of children and returns a standard DOM node.

In these docs, you'll see these kinds of functions (returned by `AIUI.tag()` or `tagfunction.extended(...)`) to as **tag functions**, or sometimes *base tag functions* if we're only talking about those returned by `AIUI.tag(...)` and not extended tags.

### The general function signature of a tag creation function is:
```typescript
TagFunctionName(
  attributes?: AttributesOfThisTag, 
  ...children:(string | number | boolean | Node | Element | NodeList | undefined | HTMLCollection 
  /* Or an array or iterable of any combination of the former */)[]
  ): Element
```
> _Note: there some simplification here, the children can also be of some other types, as we'll see in [Dynamic content](./dynamic-content.md)_


Let's change the final line of the script to:

```javascript
  document.body.appendChild(App({
    style:{
      color: 'blue'
    }
  },
  'Your first web page'));
```

The final markup now looks like:
```html
<div style="color: blue;">
  Your first web page
  <h2>Hello World</h2>
  <div>Dunno</div>
</div>
```

Note that if you specify children when invoking the functions that creates your new tag, and you have a `constructed()` member, the children are appended before `constructed()` is invoked, allowing you to modify, move or delete the specified children within the function.

Your new `App(...)` method is (almost) indistinguishable from the "base" methods returned by `AIUI.tag()`. This is intentional - you can compose new tags using your new tag function (although "App" might be a misleading name) and create instances of your new tag in _exactly the same way as you would any of the base tags_. You can even call `App.extended(...)` to derive a new version of your tag that has specialised or altered behaviour. All tag methods support **composition** (by returning contained tags from `constructed()`) and **inheritance** (via the `TagFunction.extended(...)`). The details of how to do this are presented in the corresponding sections of this guide. Both the base tag functions and your extended tag functions just return normal a DOM node.
